# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol designed to enhance the interaction between AI language models and development tools. It provides a standardized way to share context and maintain state between different components of an AI-assisted development environment.

## Key Concepts
- **Context Sharing**: Enables seamless sharing of development context between the IDE and AI models
- **State Management**: Maintains consistent state across different interactions
- **Tool Integration**: Provides standardized interfaces for integrating various development tools
- **Protocol Standards**: Defines clear communication standards between AI models and development environments

## Components
1. **Context Handlers**
   - IDE state tracking
   - File system monitoring
   - User interaction history

2. **Protocol Interfaces**
   - Tool integration APIs
   - Context serialization
   - State synchronization

3. **Development Tools**
   - GitHub integration
   - Code analysis
   - Environment management

## Benefits
- Improved context awareness in AI interactions
- Consistent development experience
- Seamless tool integration
- Enhanced development workflow

## Implementation
The protocol can be implemented in various development environments and tools to provide:
- Real-time context updates
- Persistent state management
- Standardized tool communication
